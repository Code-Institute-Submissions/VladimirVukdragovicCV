# Vladimir Vukdragovic Portfolio  
This is my first multi-page website representing my portfolio.
My goal with this project is to attract attention of my future employers and recruiters and explain who I am 
and what I do. There is a bit about myself and level of my coding skills.
Also there is a contact page so if they are interested they can ask for more details and explenations.
## Demo  
A live demo can be found [here](https://alchemist2016.github.io/VladimirVukdragovicCV/).
## UX  
### User stories
Within this project I wanted to provide clarity of purpose, natural flow of structure, and easy access to 
further informations.
This website is mainly designed for prospective employers and recruiters. 
I believe that people in these categories have time restrictions and first impression mindset. 
Therefore I was building this website with "less is better" thinking leaving room for further contact if desired so by targeted audience.
### Strategy
My goal was appealing website which provides easy as possible access to information and keeping it minimalist 
and user-friendly.
### Scope
Allowing targeted user to get all the necessary information with the option to contact me if they choose.
### Structure
I have provided short summary of the project done so far with a link to GitHub Repository and live demo. 
In the footer I haved included links to my LinkedIn profile, Facebook profile and Instagram.
As a separate link in my nav-bar I included my downloadable PDF version of my CV with a download link.
They all link to a new page opening thus keeping the integrity of original website and ease of use.

## Technologies  
1.HTML
2.CSS3
3.Bootstrap(4.4.1)
## Features  
The nav-bar and footer are used from Bootstrap with extra JavaScript for a toggle button in nav-bar. Navbar is sticky to the top at any size. Footer disapears at About Me and Projects pages to allow more room on smaller devices.
### Features left to implement
In the future, I would love to add more projects to my portfolio.
## Testing  
Testing was performed on all sizes of screens and devices. Also I have performed testing on several desktop browsers like Chrome, FireFox successfully. All links in navbar are tested and employer and recruiter can download PDF of my CV from CV link in navbar. Images in About Me are also links to wikipedia related pages. Images in Projects page are links to my GitHub repository.
Contact form is made in such a way that if you miss out or put invalid data in e-mail area you will be shown an error noting that you need to fill correct details. I have made a text area for Ideas and Comments compulsory too.
All links will open in new tab using 'target="_blank"'. All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.
During the test phase I realised that some of the text rendered on pages was different color in Microsoft Edge. That is something I need to look into in the future.
## Deployment  
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. Updates are automatic with new commits. In order to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.
## Credits

All content in About me page was written by me.
### Media
